### **Vim (Vi Improved) Detailed Notes**
As a **developer** and **system security engineer**, Vim can become an indispensable tool for editing code, configuration files, and system logs directly from the terminal. These notes cover **Vim** in detail, breaking down its various functionalities, commands, and use cases tailored to your work.

---

## **1. What is Vim?**
**Vim** (Vi Improved) is a text editor that comes pre-installed on almost every Linux system. It is an enhanced version of the original **Vi** editor, featuring additional functionalities like syntax highlighting, multi-level undo, split windows, plugins, and much more.

### **Why Use Vim?**
- **Efficiency**: Vim allows fast, keyboard-based editing, making you productive when working on code or system files.
- **Availability**: Vim is available by default in most Linux distributions, making it highly portable.
- **Extensibility**: Vim supports plugins that can extend its functionality for development, version control, or security auditing.

---

## **2. Vim vs. Vi**
- **Vi**: The original, lightweight text editor. Minimal features.
- **Vim**: An extended version of Vi with powerful additional features such as:
    - Syntax highlighting.
    - Unlimited undo/redo.
    - Support for plugins and macros.

---

## **3. Installing Vim**
If Vim is not installed by default on your system, you can install it:
- On **RHEL/CentOS**:
    `sudo dnf install vim -y`
    
- On **Ubuntu**:    
    `sudo apt install vim -y`

## **4. Vim Modes**
Vim operates in different modes, each serving a distinct purpose. Understanding these modes is key to mastering Vim.

| Mode        | Description                                             | How to Enter                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Normal**  | Default mode for navigation and commands.               | Start Vim or press `ESC`    |
| **Insert**  | Text editing mode for inserting characters.             | Press `i`, `a`, or `o`      |
| **Visual**  | Mode for selecting text to manipulate (cut/copy/paste). | Press `v`, `V`, or `Ctrl+v` |
| **Command** | Mode for executing commands like saving, quitting.      | Press `:` in Normal Mode    |

## **5. Starting Vim**
To open a file in Vim, use the command:
`vim filename`

### **Opening Multiple Files**
`vim file1 file2 file3`

You can navigate between files using:
- `:n` – Move to the next file.
- `:prev` – Move to the previous file.

---

## **6. Basic Commands in Normal Mode**
### **File Management**
- **Save a file**: `:w`
- **Save and quit**: `:wq`
- **Quit without saving**: `:q!`

### **Cursor Movement**
- `h` – Left.
- `j` – Down.
- `k` – Up.
- `l` – Right.

For faster navigation:
- `0` – Go to the beginning of the line.
- `$` – Go to the end of the line.
- `gg` – Go to the first line of the file.
- `G` – Go to the last line of the file.
- `:n` – Go to line number `n`.

### **Copy, Cut, and Paste**
- `yy` – Copy the current line.
- `dd` – Cut (delete) the current line.
- `p` – Paste after the cursor position.
- `P` – Paste before the cursor.

### **Undo and Redo**
- `u` – Undo the last change.
- `Ctrl + r` – Redo the last undone change.

---

## **7. Insert Mode**
To enter Insert mode, use one of the following commands:
- `i` – Insert before the cursor.
- `a` – Append after the cursor.
- `o` – Open a new line below.

Once in **Insert Mode**, you can type text normally. Press `ESC` to return to **Normal Mode**.

---

## **8. Visual Mode**
Visual mode allows you to select text for cutting, copying, or modifying.

### **Selecting Text**
- Press `v` to select by character.
- Press `V` to select by line.
- Press `Ctrl + v` for block selection (visual block mode).

Once selected, you can:

- **Cut**: `d`.
- **Copy**: `y`.
- **Paste**: `p`.

---

## **9. Command Mode**
Command mode is used to perform file operations, search and replace, and execute other advanced commands.

### **Basic Commands**
- **Save**: `:w`.
- **Quit**: `:q`.
- **Save and Quit**: `:wq`.
- **Quit without Saving**: `:q!`.

### **Searching**
- **Search for a term**: `/term`.
- **Move to next match**: `n`.
- **Move to previous match**: `N`.

---

## **10. Advanced Editing Techniques**
### **Find and Replace**
- Replace a word globally:
    `:%s/old_word/new_word/g`
    
    The `g` flag means replace globally in the entire file. You can add the `c` flag for confirmation:
    `:%s/old_word/new_word/gc`
    

### **Working with Buffers**
Vim allows you to work with multiple open files in buffers.
- **Open a buffer**: `:e filename`.
- **List all buffers**: `:ls`.
- **Switch to a buffer**: `:b buffer_number`.
- **Close a buffer**: `:bd`.

### **Splitting Windows**
To view multiple files or sections of the same file:
- **Horizontal split**: `:split`.
- **Vertical split**: `:vsplit`.

To navigate between windows, use `Ctrl + w` followed by one of `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`.

---

## **11. Macros**
Vim allows you to record a sequence of commands and play them back, which can be helpful for repetitive tasks.

### **Recording a Macro**
1. Start recording a macro with `qx` (where `x` is any letter to name the macro).
2. Perform your editing commands.
3. Stop recording with `q`.

### **Playing Back a Macro*

- Use `@x` to execute the macro recorded under the letter `x`.
- You can repeat a macro multiple times with `5@x` (to execute the macro 5 times).

## **12. Customization in Vim**
### **Vim Configuration File**
Vim's behavior can be customized by editing the `~/.vimrc` file. Here, you can set options to make your Vim experience smoother.

### **Example .vimrc File**
```
set number            " Show line numbers
set autoindent        " Auto-indent new lines
set tabstop=4         " Set tab width to 4 spaces
set shiftwidth=4      " Set indentation width
set expandtab         " Use spaces instead of tabs
syntax on             " Enable syntax highlighting
set background=dark   " Set background to dark
```

### **Install Plugins**
To extend Vim’s capabilities, you can install plugins using plugin managers like **Vundle** or **Pathogen**.

### **Example - Install Vundle**:
1. Clone Vundle:    
    `git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
    
2. Add the following to your `.vimrc`:
```
set nocompatible
filetype off
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()
Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'
" Add other plugins here
call vundle#end()
filetype plugin indent on
```
    
3. Install plugins:
    `:PluginInstall`

## **13. Using Vim as a System Security Engineer**
As a **System Security Engineer**, Vim is crucial for editing system files like:
- **/etc/passwd** (User management).
- **/etc/hosts** (Host configurations).
- **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** (SSH server configurations).

### **Read-Only Mode**
To safely view system files without accidentally making changes, use:
`vim -R filename`

### **Encrypt Files in Vim**
You can encrypt files to secure sensitive configurations:
1. Open a file and enter **Command Mode**.
2. Type:
    `:X`
    
3. Set a password to encrypt the file.

Next time you open the file, Vim will prompt you for the password.
## **14. Troubleshooting in Vim**
### **Recovering Files**
Vim creates swap files to help recover unsaved changes. If Vim crashes, you can recover the file using:
`vim -r filename`

### **Getting Help**
Vim has built-in documentation accessible by typing `:help`. You can get specific help for any command by typing `:help command_name`.
