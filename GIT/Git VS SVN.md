The main differences between SVN (Subversion) and Git revolve around their architecture, workflows, and features:

### 1. **Centralized vs Distributed Version Control:**

- **SVN (Subversion):**
    
    - Centralized version control system.
    - Uses a central repository where all developers commit changes.
    - Requires network access to perform most operations (commit, revert, update).
- **Git:**
    
    - Distributed version control system.
    - Each developer has a local repository with the complete project history.
    - Works offline, as most operations are performed locally (commit, revert, history inspection).

### 2. **Branching and Merging:**

- **SVN:**
    
    - Branching and merging are more complex.
    - Branches are copies of the entire project directory.
    - Merging is often manual and can be error-prone.
- **Git:**
    
    - Branching and merging are lightweight and integral to the workflow.
    - Branches are lightweight pointers to commits.
    - Supports powerful merging algorithms and tools (e.g., rebase).

### 3. **Performance:**

- **SVN:**
    
    - Slower performance for operations like branching, merging, and history traversal.
    - Larger repositories and longer histories can impact performance negatively.
- **Git:**
    
    - Faster performance, especially for branching, merging, and history inspection.
    - Distributed nature allows operations to be performed locally, reducing network dependency.

### 4. **Workflow and Flexibility:**

- **SVN:**
    
    - Follows a more centralized workflow.
    - Strict check-in and check-out model.
    - More rigid in terms of workflow adaptation.
- **Git:**
    
    - Supports various workflows (centralized, feature branching, GitFlow, etc.).
    - Greater flexibility in branching strategies and collaboration models.
    - Developers can work independently and merge changes as needed.

### 5. **Repository Structure:**

- **SVN:**
    
    - Uses a centralized repository structure with trunk, branches, and tags.
    - Each branch is a full copy of the project directory.
- **Git:**
    
    - Supports various repository structures, including centralized (like SVN), but often uses feature branches and distributed workflows.
    - Projects can have multiple remote repositories (origin, upstream) for collaboration.

### 6. **Community and Tooling:**

- **SVN:**
    
    - Mature community and ecosystem, though less active compared to Git.
    - Integrated with various IDEs and development tools.
- **Git:**
    
    - Highly active open-source community with extensive tooling and support.
    - Widely adopted across different platforms and services (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

### Conclusion:

- **SVN** is suitable for teams accustomed to a centralized workflow with strong access controls.
- **Git** is more flexible, scalable, and performs better for distributed teams, complex branching strategies, and larger repositories.

Choosing between SVN and Git often depends on team size, project complexity, and existing workflows. Git's distributed nature and flexibility make it increasingly popular, especially for modern software development practices.
