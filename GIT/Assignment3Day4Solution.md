### Assignment: Create and Host Your Portfolio on GitHub Pages
**Objective:**  
Build a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Host it on GitHub Pages using a repository named after your GitHub username, followed by `.github.io`. Use Git for version control throughout the process.

### Tasks:
1. **Setup Your Repository:**
    
    - **Create a New Repository:**
        - Go to GitHub and create a new repository with the name formatted as `username.github.io` (replace `username` with your actual GitHub username).
        - Clone the repository to your local machine using:

            `git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git`
            
        - Navigate to the repository directory:

            `cd username.github.io`
            
2. **Build Your Portfolio:**
    - **HTML:**
        
        - Create an `index.html` file. This will be the main page of your portfolio.
        - Include sections such as `About Me`, `Projects`, `Skills`, `Contact`, etc.
        - Add a navigation bar to navigate between sections.
        - Example:
        - (HTML)[html]


	- **CSS:**
        
        - Create a `styles.css` file to style your portfolio.
        - Use Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout.
        - Apply custom fonts, colors, and styles to make your portfolio visually appealing.
        - Example: 
        - (CSS)[css]
    


	- **JavaScript:**
        
        - Create a `script.js` file for interactivity.
        - Add smooth scrolling for navigation links.
        - Implement any other JavaScript-based functionality, such as form validation for the contact section.
        - Example:
        - (JavaScript)[js]


            
3. **Version Control with Git:**
    - **Stage and Commit Changes:**
        - Add your project files to the repository:
            `git add .`
            
        - Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
            `git commit -m "Initial commit: Add portfolio website files"`
            
    - **Push Changes to GitHub:**
        - Push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub:
            `git push origin main`
            
4. **Host on GitHub Pages:**
    
    - **Enable GitHub Pages:**
        - Go to the repository on GitHub and navigate to the "Settings" tab.
        - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
        - Under "Source", select the `main` branch and save.
    - **View Your Hosted Portfolio:**
        - Your portfolio will be hosted at `https://username.github.io`.
5. **Test and Share:**
    
    - Visit the URL `https://username.github.io` to view your hosted portfolio.
    - Test your website to ensure everything is working correctly (e.g., navigation, form submissions).
    - Share your portfolio URL with others.

### Bonus Tasks:
- **README.md:**
    - Add a README.md file to your repository describing your portfolio and the technologies used.
- **Responsive Design:**
    - Implement responsive design using media queries to ensure your portfolio looks good on all devices.
- **Custom Domain:**
    - Add a custom domain to your GitHub Pages site if you own one.
