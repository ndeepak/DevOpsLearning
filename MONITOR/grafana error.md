# If you're seeing this Grafana has failed to load its application files

1. This could be caused by your reverse proxy settings.
2. If you host grafana under a subpath make sure your `grafana.ini` `root_url` setting includes subpath. If not using a reverse proxy make sure to set `serve_from_sub_path` to true.
3. If you have a local dev build make sure you build frontend using: `yarn start`, or `yarn build`.
4. Sometimes restarting `grafana-server` can help.
5. Check if you are using a non-supported browser. For more information, refer to the list of [supporte](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/requirements/#supported-web-browsers)
