The organized list of questions and their corresponding answers related to Maven:

1. **Differences between ANT and Maven**
    
    - **ANT:** Procedural, XML-based build tool. Needs explicit dependencies management.
    - **Maven:** Declarative, convention-over-configuration build tool with built-in dependency management.
2. **Creating a JAR/WAR file in Maven**
    
    - Use `mvn package` command to generate JAR/WAR file in Maven.
3. **Difference between `mvn deploy` and `mvn install`**
    
    - **mvn deploy:** Deploys built artifact to remote repository.
    - **mvn install:** Installs built artifact into local repository.
4. **Maven Lifecycle Phases**
    
    - **init:** Initializes a new Maven project.
    - **validate:** Validates if project is correct and all necessary information is available.
    - **compile:** Compiles source code of the project.
    - **test:** Runs tests against compiled source code.
    - **package:** Packages compiled code into distributable format.
    - **install:** Installs package into local repository.
    - **deploy:** Copies final package to the remote repository.
5. **What is Maven? Why do we use Maven?**
    
    - Maven is a build automation tool primarily used for Java projects to manage dependencies, build lifecycle, and project management.
6. **Handling Missing Jar Files in Maven**
    
    - Add the missing dependency to the `pom.xml` file under `<dependencies>` section.
7. **Maven Coordinates and POM.xml**
    
    - **groupId:** Group or organization that the project belongs to.
    - **artifactId:** Name of the project or module.
    - **version:** Version of the project.
    - Coordinates uniquely identify artifacts in Maven repositories and are mandatory in `pom.xml`.
8. **Difference between SNAPSHOT and RELEASE versions**
    
    - **SNAPSHOT:** Indicates a development version under active development.
    - **RELEASE:** Indicates a stable, production-ready version.
9. **Default Naming Convention of Artifacts**
    
    - By default, Maven uses `<artifactId>-<version>.<extension>` for naming artifacts.
10. **Generating a Site in Maven**
    
    - Use `mvn site` command to generate a project site with reports and documentation.
11. **Running a Clean Build in Maven**
    
    - Use `mvn clean install` to clean previous builds and perform a fresh build.
12. **Adding a Dependency in Maven POM.xml**
    
    - Add a `<dependency>` section with `<groupId>`, `<artifactId>`, and `<version>` of the dependency.
13. **What is a Plugin?**
    
    - Plugins are extensions that provide additional capabilities to Maven, such as compiling code, running tests, or creating artifacts.
14. **Default Path of Artifacts in Local Repository**
    
    - Artifacts are stored in `<user_home>/.m2/repository` by default.
15. **Creating a Project in Maven**
    
    - Use `mvn archetype:generate` and select an appropriate archetype to create a new Maven project.
16. **Binary Repositories in Maven**
    
    - Maven Central Repository is commonly used. Other repositories include Nexus, Artifactory for custom repositories.
17. **Customizing Artifact Name in Maven**
    
    - Use `<finalName>` element in the `<build>` section of `pom.xml` to customize the artifact name.
18. **Transitive Dependency in Maven**
    
    - Dependencies required by a project's dependencies. Maven resolves transitive dependencies automatically.
19. **Scope Parameter in Dependency Section**
    
    - Controls the visibility of a dependency. Common scopes include compile, provided, runtime, and test.

These answers should help you understand and prepare for questions related to Maven, its usage, configuration, and best practices.
