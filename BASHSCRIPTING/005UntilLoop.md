### **Until Loop in Bash: A Comprehensive Guide**

#### **1. Introduction to the Until Loop**
The `until` loop in Bash is used to execute a block of commands repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Unlike the `while` loop, which continues as long as the condition is true, the `until` loop continues as long as the condition is false. Once the condition becomes true, the loop terminates.

#### **2. Syntax of the Until Loop**
The basic syntax of an `until` loop is as follows:
```
until [ condition ]
do
    # Commands to be executed
done
```

- **`condition`**: This is the condition that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. The loop continues until this condition becomes true.
- **`do`...`done`**: This block contains the commands that will be executed during each iteration of the loop.

#### **3. Example: Basic Until Loop**
Hereâ€™s a simple example of an `until` loop that increments a counter until it reaches 5:
```
#!/bin/bash

counter=1

until [ $counter -gt 5 ]
do
    echo "Counter: $counter"
    ((counter++))
done
```

**Output:**
```
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Counter: 3
Counter: 4
Counter: 5
```

- In this example, the loop continues to execute as long as the `counter` is less than or equal to 5. Once `counter` becomes greater than 5, the loop terminates.

#### **4. Practical Example: Waiting for a File to Exist**
The `until` loop is often used in scripts where you need to wait for a specific condition to be met, such as waiting for a file to exist.

- **Example:**
```
#!/bin/bash

file="/tmp/myfile.txt"

until [ -f "$file" ]
do
    echo "Waiting for $file to be created..."
    sleep 2
done

echo "$file has been created."
```

**Output:**
```
Waiting for /tmp/myfile.txt to be created...
Waiting for /tmp/myfile.txt to be created...
...
/tmp/myfile.txt has been created.
```

- This script checks if the file `/tmp/myfile.txt` exists. If the file does not exist, the loop continues, printing a message and sleeping for 2 seconds. Once the file is created, the loop exits and the script prints a confirmation message.

#### **5. Comparison with the While Loop**
The main difference between the `until` loop and the `while` loop is the condition under which they run:

- **`while` loop**: Executes as long as the condition is true.
- **`until` loop**: Executes as long as the condition is false.

This distinction can be useful depending on how you want to control the flow of your script.

#### **6. Infinite Until Loop**
Just like `while` loops, `until` loops can become infinite if the condition never becomes true. For example:
```
#!/bin/bash

until false
do
    echo "This will run forever"
done
```

- This script will run indefinitely because the condition (`false`) will never become true.

#### **7. Breaking Out of an Until Loop**
You can use the `break` statement to exit an `until` loop prematurely, regardless of the condition:
```
#!/bin/bash

counter=1

until [ $counter -gt 5 ]
do
    echo "Counter: $counter"
    ((counter++))
    if [ $counter -eq 3 ]; then
        break
    fi
done

echo "Loop terminated early."
```

**Output:**
```
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Loop terminated early.
```

- In this example, the loop breaks when the `counter` reaches 3, even though the condition to stop the loop was `counter > 5`.

#### **8. Conclusion**
The `until` loop is a versatile control structure in Bash scripting, particularly useful when you need to wait for a condition to become true. It can help make your scripts more responsive to real-world conditions, such as waiting for files, processes, or other events to occur.
