## **Linux File System Hierarchy**
The Linux file system is a tree-like structure that starts at the **root directory (`/`)**, which contains all other directories and files.
### **Root Directory (`/`)**
The root directory is the base of the Linux file system. All other directories are mounted under it. Below are the key subdirectories:

| **Directory** | **Purpose**                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/bin`        | Contains essential binary executables required by all users (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `bash`).                             |
| `/boot`       | Contains boot-related files, including the kernel (`vmlinuz`), bootloader configuration, and initial RAM disk (`initrd`). |
| `/dev`        | Contains device files representing hardware devices (e.g., `/dev/sda` for disks).                                         |
| `/etc`        | Contains system-wide configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`).                                             |
| `/home`       | Home directories for user accounts (e.g., `/home/user`).                                                                  |
| `/lib`        | Contains shared libraries needed by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.                                                       |
| `/media`      | Default mount points for removable media (e.g., USB drives, CDs).                                                         |
| `/mnt`        | Generic mount point for temporarily mounting filesystems.                                                                 |
| `/opt`        | Contains optional software packages.                                                                                      |
| `/sbin`       | Contains system binaries used by administrators (e.g., `fdisk`, `fsck`).                                                  |
| `/srv`        | Contains data served by the system (e.g., web server files).                                                              |
| `/tmp`        | Temporary files created by programs. Cleared upon reboot.                                                                 |
| `/usr`        | Contains user utilities and applications (`/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/share`).                                          |
| `/proc`       | Virtual filesystem providing system information (e.g., `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`).                                 |

## **Permissions in Linux**
### **Permission Basics**
In Linux, every file and directory has associated permissions for three types of users:

1. **Owner**: The user who owns the file/directory.
2. **Group**: A group of users with shared permissions.
3. **Others**: All other users.

### **Permission Types**
Each file or directory permission is divided into three categories:
- **Read (`r`)**: Permission to view the contents of a file or list a directory.
- **Write (`w`)**: Permission to modify a file or create/delete files in a directory.
- **Execute (`x`)**: Permission to execute a file or traverse a directory.

### **Permission Format**
Permissions are displayed in the following format when using `ls -l`:
`drwxr-xr--`

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|`d`|Type (e.g., `d` for directory, `-` for file).|
|`rwx`|Owner's permissions (read, write, execute).|
|`r-x`|Group's permissions (read, execute).|
|`r--`|Others' permissions (read only).|

## **Commands to Manage Permissions**
### 1. **`chmod` (Change Mode)**
The `chmod` command is used to modify file or directory permissions.
#### **Syntax**
`chmod [options] [permissions] [file/directory]`
#### **Methods to Use `chmod`**
1. **Symbolic Mode:**

    - Modify permissions using symbols (`+`, `-`, `=`).
    - Examples:
```
chmod u+r file.txt    # Add read permission for the owner
chmod g-w file.txt    # Remove write permission for the group
chmod o=x file.txt    # Set execute permission for others
chmod a+rwx file.txt  # Set read, write, and execute for all
```
        
2. **Numeric (Octal) Mode:**
    - Represent permissions with numbers:
        - `4`: Read (`r`)
        - `2`: Write (`w`)
        - `1`: Execute (`x`)
    - Examples:
 ```
chmod 755 file.txt  # Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: r-x
chmod 644 file.txt  # Owner: rw-, Group: r--, Others: r--
```


    - Combine numbers for each user type:
```
7 = Read + Write + Execute
6 = Read + Write
5 = Read + Execute
4 = Read only
```

### 2. **`chown` (Change Ownership)**
The `chown` command is used to change the ownership of a file or directory.
#### **Syntax**
`chown [options] [owner][:group] [file/directory]`
#### **Examples**
1. Change the owner of a file:
    `chown username file.txt`
    
2. Change both owner and group:
    `chown username:groupname file.txt`
    
3. Recursively change ownership for a directory:
    `chown -R username:groupname /path/to/directory`
    

---

### 3. **`chgrp` (Change Group Ownership)**
The `chgrp` command is used to change the group ownership of a file or directory.
#### **Syntax**
`chgrp [options] [group] [file/directory]`

#### **Examples**
1. Change the group of a file:
    `chgrp groupname file.txt`
    
2. Recursively change the group for a directory:
    `chgrp -R groupname /path/to/directory`

---
### **Examples: Combining Commands**

1. **Set permissions and ownership for a file:**
    `chmod 640 file.txt `
    `chown user1:group1 file.txt`
2. **Make a script executable and assign it to a group:**
    `chmod +x script.sh `
    `chgrp developers script.sh`
3. **Grant full access to the owner and no access to others:**
    `chmod 700 private.txt`
4. **Recursively set ownership and permissions for a directory:**
    `chown -R admin:admin /var/www `
    `chmod -R 755 /var/www`

---
### **Tips for Managing Permissions**
- **Avoid `777` permissions**: This gives full access to everyone, which is a security risk.
- Use **`ls -l`** to verify permissions:
    `ls -l file.txt`
    
- Use **groups** to simplify access management for multiple users.
